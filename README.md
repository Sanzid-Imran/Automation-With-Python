# Automation-With-Python

This is a simple program to process your Excel sheet.
Particaularly in this program the datas of 3rd column had to be changed i.e. to reduced to 90%
Now it's very much easy when someone have just a couple of datas. But when it comes to large number of data sets this program might help you out.

And as it's made portable ,What you need to do is to simply import this and call the method and pass your desired file that needa be updated with the new format i.e. the updated value in a seperate column.

And also a bar chart is shown to visualize the data.
